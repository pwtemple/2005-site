  PW Temple was established by Peter Temple in 1981. Specialising in the renovation
  and restoration of old properties and barn conversions, the business has grown
  steadily. We now have ten full-time staff as well as sub-contractors used on a regular basis for reliability and quality of work.  Tradesmen
  experienced in all aspects of the industry are employed, with particular emphasis
  on stonework, plastering, brickwork and electrical work. </div>

<div class="b1" id="Para2" style="position:absolute; width:435px; height:75px; z-index:6; left: 160px; top: 180px">
  This is a family-run business, with Peter's wife Barbara managing the accounts
  office and his son, Richard, an electrician. There is a continuing youth training
  policy in operation, with apprentices employed in bricklaying, plastering and
  electrical work. Our first apprentice, appointed in 1987 as a plasterer, won
  the British Gypsum award for "Plasterer of the Year" at Carlisle College - and
  this same employee continues to work for us, now as senior foreman.</div>
<div class="b1" id="Para3" style="position:absolute; width:435px; height:65px; z-index:7; left:12px; top: 275px">Our
  business has its premises in the hamlet of Aughertree, near Ireby. From this
  location, on the Northern edge of the fell country of the Lake District National
  Park, there is good access to the major towns of the West coast, the city of
  Carlisle and the busy town of Penrith. There are also good connections to the
  fast road network to both Scotland and the rest of England.</div>
<div id="Picture2" style="position:absolute; width:128px; height:120px; z-index:8; left: 462px; top: 290px"><img src="pix/landscape.jpg" width="125" height="118"></div>
<div class="b1" id="Para4" style="position:absolute; width:435px; height:80px; z-index:9; left: 12px; top: 340px">Equally
  importantly, the immediate area with its unspoilt villages set in rolling countryside
  provides the business with ample opportunities to maintain traditional building
  skills whilst utilising the best modern practice. Work ranges from small repairs
  to large conversions. Farm and barns, mills and other former industrial premises
  are meticulously renovated to provide new accommodation. At all times the development
  is sympathetic to the surrounding environment. </div>

  <div class="b1" id="Para5" style="position:absolute; width:435px; height:55px; z-index:11; left: 160px; top: 440px">The
    quality of work of PW Temple has been recognised by recent awards such as
    the Allerdale Borough Council's "Built in Quality Award" and the Federation of Master
    Builders' "Master Builder of the Year" regional competition success. The business
    is a member of both the FMB and the NICEIC. </div>
<div class="b1" id="Para6" style="position:absolute; width:302px; height:30px; z-index:12; left: 160px; top: 495px">
  Peter has held the Branch Presidency and Chair of Carlisle Branch of the Federation
  of Master Builders, and currently represents the branch as regional delegate
  in Newcastle. His reputation for attention to quality has seen him appointed
  by the Construction Industry Training Board as a Skills' Assessor at Carlisle
  College, where he assesses the Plastering Apprentice Skills Tests.</div>
